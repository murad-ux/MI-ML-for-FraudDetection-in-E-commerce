# 💻 Machine Learning for Fraud Detection in E-commerce 🚨

This project dives into the exciting world of **machine learning** 📊 and its application in **fraud detection**. We analyze and compare various supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms through detailed case studies, using real-world datasets. You'll find Python implementations 🐍 along with insights into how these models perform when tasked with detecting fraudulent behavior.

The project is divided into three major case studies, each showcasing different machine learning approaches: **Random Forest**, **Comparative Supervised Methods** (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Decision Trees), and **Unsupervised Learning** with clustering techniques.

## 🔍 Case Studies Overview

This project revolves around three distinct case studies, each focusing on different machine learning techniques.

### Case Study 1: 🌲 Random Forest Algorithm for Fraud Detection

We explore the power of the **Random Forest** algorithm in fraud detection scenarios. Key topics covered include:

- 🌟 Why Random Forest is effective for fraud detection.
- 🔍 Outlier detection and feature engineering methods.
- 💻 Python implementation, including model building, evaluation, and recursive feature elimination.
- 📊 Results and analysis of fraud detection using Random Forest.

### Case Study 2: 🔄 Comparative Analysis of Supervised Learning Methods

In this study, we compare three popular supervised learning algorithms: **Logistic Regression**, **Naive Bayes**, and **Decision Trees**. The following sections are explored:

- 📊 Comparative analysis of these methods for fraud detection.
- 🧠 Explanation of how each algorithm works.
- 🚀 Applications of each method in fraud detection.
- 💻 Python implementation, covering data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and key findings.

### Case Study 3: 🔗 Unsupervised Learning for Fraud Detection

We dive into clustering techniques for fraud detection, focusing on **density-based clustering** with **DBSCAN**. This case study includes:

- 🎯 The role of unsupervised algorithms in fraud detection.
- 🔎 Detailed steps for outlier detection using **Z-Score** and **DBSCAN** methods.
- 💻 Python code for clustering, data sampling, and result evaluation.
